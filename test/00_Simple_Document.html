    <h1>A Very Simple Quiet Text Document</h1>

    <p>

      This is a simple document consisting of only a title and a few paragraphs.
      Like all good paragraphs, these paragraphs contain multiple sentences, each separated by a full stop (period) and two spaces.
      I may also be able to contrive an example of where a double quote or parentheses comes between the punctuation mark and the two spaces.

    </p>

    <p>

      The intent is to demonstrate the basics of Quiet Text.
      Above all, you're supposed to be able to write readable text files.
      Quiet Text is more about extracting structure and styling from a well formatted text file.
      The text files are intended to be readable by themselves &mdash; they're not the "source file" for a PDF or a HTML file.

    </p>

    <p>

      But we live in a world where HTML and PDF are popular, so it's madness to ignore that.
      But my  toolchain has me typing content into a text file with a text editor.
      I edit the content and only then do I consider converting it into some other format.
      Quiet Text originated with the observation that I live in a terminal window.
      Text files (first ASCII, then UTF-8) files on a hard drive I edit with Emacs are the center of my intellectual life.
      Like Unix(tm), for me, everything is a file.

    </p>

    <p>

      But I forgot to demonstrate a sentence with a trailing quote.
      Remember, I divide sentences with a punctuation mark and two spaces.
      But what if you have a parenthetical aside (like this one?)
      What will the parser look for?
      How will it know "what to do?"
      Parentheses and quotes (even single quotes) don't confuse the parser because it knows sentences are separated with a punctuation mark, an optional quote, double quote, close parentheses or close square bracket followed by either a newline or two (or more) spaces.

      I hope that you're reading the text version of this file.
      You should see that it's quite readable.
      There's no "shouty" markup.
      Not a single HTML element to be seen.
      Just text.

    </p>

    <p>

      We can use the <code>warp</code> and <code>weft</code> tools to build a HTML version of this file.
      And from there we could use PrinceXML, PhantomJS or wkhtmltopdf to convert the HTML file to a PDF.

    </p>

    <p>

      For the curious, this file is used to test the function of the quiet-text lexxer and parser and the <code>warp</code> utility.
