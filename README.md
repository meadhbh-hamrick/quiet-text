<p class="abstract">

  Quiet Text is a set of conventions for extracting structure
  and markup from regular UTF-8 text.  Documents following
  these conventions may be used directly (as text files) or
  converted to XML/DocBook, HTML, RTF or PDF formats.  Quiet
  Text largely (but not completely) eschews explicit markup,
  extracting content, structure and styling from position,
  indentation and punctuation.

  This repository contains documentation describing Quiet Text
  conventions and tools to manipulate text documents that
  follow them.

<h3>More Information About Quiet Text</h3>

<p>

  The best place to start learning about Quiet Text is the
  Quiet Text Web Site at
  <a href="https://quiet.meadhbh.hamrick.rocks/">https://quiet.meadhbh.hamrick.rocks/</a> .
  It describes the format of a typical quiet text document, how
  they're converted to other formats and a bit about the
  project's history.

</p>

<p>
  [ While the Quiet Text Web Site is under construction, information about Quiet Text conventions and tools may be found in <a href="./project/00_Introduction.md">./project/00_Introduction.md</a>, <a href="./project/10_Features.md">./project/10_Features.md</a> and <a href="./project/20_Design.md">./project/20_Design.md</a>. ]
</p>

<p>
  
  The web site is mechanically generated from the web site
  source code in the <a href="./site">./site</a> directory
  using tools found in the <a href="./bin">./bin</a> directory.
  You can generate a local copy of the site using the
  <a href="./Makefile">./Makefile</a> in this directory, though
  you will need a recent version of node.js and
  <code>make</code> installed.

</p>

<p>

  The <a href="./examples">./examples</a> directory contains
  examples of using Quiet Text to generate product
  documentation, a simple web site and HTML fragments using the
  tools provided by this repo.

<h3>More Information About Tools in this Repository</h3>

<p>

  The two primary tools included in this repository are the
  <code>warp</code> and <code>weft</code> tools.
  <code>Warp</code> extracts content and markup from a source
  text file and produces a JSON object representing the
  document.  <code>Weft</code> takes a JSON object (like one
  generated by <code>warp</code>) and converts it into a HTML
  file.

<p>
          
  The <a href="https://quiet.meadhbh.hamrick.rocks/tools/">Tools</a>
  section of the web site describes how to use these utilities.
