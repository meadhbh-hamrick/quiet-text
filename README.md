<p class="abstract">

  Quiet Text is a set of conventions for extracting
  structure and markup from regular UTF-8 text.
  Documents following these conventions may be used
  directly (as text files) or converted to XML/DocBook,
  HTML, RTF or PDF formats.  Quiet Text largely eschews
  explicit markup, extracting semantic intent from
  structure, position and indentation.

<p class="abstract">

  This repository contains documentation describing Quiet
  Text conventions and tools to manipulate text files
  that follow them.

<h3>More Information About Quiet Text</h3>

<p>
        
  The best place to start learning about Quiet Text is
  the Quiet Text Web Site at
  <a href="https://quiet.meadhbh.hamrick/">https://quiet.meadhbh.hamrick/</a>.
  It describes the format of a typical quiet text
  document, how they're converted to other formats
  and a bit about the project's history.

</p>
      
<p>
        
  The web site is mechanically generated from the web
  site source code in the <a href="./site">./site</a>
  directory using tools found in the
  <a href="./bin">./bin</a> directory.  You can generate
  a local copy of the site using the
  <a href="./Makefile">./Makefile</a> file in this
  directory if you have a recent version of node.js
  and the make utility installed.

</p>

<p>
        
  The <a href="./examples">./examples </a> directory
  contains examples of using Quiet Text to generate
  product documentation, a simple web site and HTML
  fragments using the tools described here.

<h3>More Information About Tools in this Repository</h3>

<p>

  The two primary tools included in this repository
  are the <code>warp</code> and <code>weft</code>
  tools.  <code>Warp</code> extracts content and
  markup from a source text file and outputs a JSON
  object representing the document.
  <code>Weft</code> takes a JSON object (like the
  one generated by <code>warp</code>) and converts
  it into a HTML file.

<p>
          
  The
  <a href="https://quiet.meadhbh.rocks/tools/">Tools</a>
  section of the web site describes how to use these
  utilities.
