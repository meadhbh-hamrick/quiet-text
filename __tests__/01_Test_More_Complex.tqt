   This is a simple document to test the warp lexxer and
   parser.  It can also be used as an example quiet text
   document.

:: Introduction

   This is intended to be a simple test document.  We have a
   few paragraphs in a couple of sections.  There's also a
   couple of lists, some of which are indented.  Here's some
   terminology:

   ** Lines vs. Blocks vs. Paragraphs -- A //line// is a line
      of text, a series of characters terminated with an end of
      line character or the end of a file.  A //block// of text
      is one or more successive lines with the similar
      indentation.  Blocks towards the beginning of the text
      usually represent metadata.  Blocks that start with a
      section header marker are section headers.  Otherwise
      they're probably //paragraphs//.

   ** Paragraphs and Sentences -- Paragraphs are represented as
      either a line of text or an array of //sentences//.  The
      ``warp`` tool //should// separated sentences when it
      see's a //punctuation mark// and two spaces.  (You can
      also put a single quote ('), a double quote ("), a close
      parentheses (')') or a a close brace (]) between the
      punctuation mark and the two spaces.  (This is to support
      the use case of terminating a sentence inside a
      parenthetical aside.)  [Or an editorial comment from the
      editor --Ed.]

      A period on the end of a line is assumed to terminate a
      sentence, so don't end lines with initialisms like J. S.
      Bach.  This last sentence will confuse the lexxer.  If
      you care about proper sentence recognition, then put the
      whole initialism on it's own line.  This is sub-optimal,
      but I don't think J. S. Bach or Philip K. Dick will care.

   ** Markers -- A //marker// is a bit of markup describing
      a structural or stylistic implication.  "In Line Markers"
      include double slashes (\//) which enclose text intended
      to be italicized.  Double underscores (\__) enclose
      underlined content.  Double less-than digraphs (\<<) and
      double greater-than digraphs (/>>) enclose <<STRONG>>
      text.  STRONG text will probably be rendered with a
      <<bold>> font.

      The double-hyphen digraph (\--) represents an emdash or
      a field separator.  In this text we're using it as a
      field separator.  If the first sentence in an unordered
      list has a
