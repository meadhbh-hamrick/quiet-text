A Very Simple Quiet Text Document

This is a simple document consisting of only a title and a few
paragraphs.  Like all good paragraphs, these paragraphs contain
multiple sentences, each separated by a full stop (period) and
two spaces.  I may also be able to contrive an example of where
a double quote or parentheses comes between the punctuation
mark and the two spaces.

The intent is to demonstrate the basics of Quiet Text.  Above
all, you're supposed to be able to write readable text files.
Quiet Text is more about extracting structure and styling from
a well formatted text file.  The text files are intended to be
readable by themselves -- they're not the "source file" for a
PDF or a HTML file.

But we live in a world where HTML and PDF are popular, so it's
madness to ignore that.  But my toolchain has me typing content
into a text file with a text editor.  I edit the content and
only then do I consider converting it into some other format.
Quiet Text originated with the observation that I live in a
terminal window.  Text files (first ASCII, then UTF-8) files
on a hard drive I edit with Emacs are the center of my
intellectual life.  Like Unix(tm), for me, everything is a
file.

But I forgot to demonstrate a sentence with a trailing quote.
Remember, I divide sentences with a punctuation mark and two
spaces.  But what if you have a parenthetical aside (like this
one?)  What will the parser look for?  How will it know "what
to do?"  Parentheses and quotes (even single quotes) don't
confuse the parser because it knows sentences are separated
with a punctuation mark, an optional quote, double quote,
close parentheses or close square bracket followed by either
a newline or two (or more) spaces.

I hope that you're reading the text version of this file.  You
should see that it's quite readable.  There's no "shouty"
markup.  Not a single HTML element to be seen.  Just text.

We can use the ``warp`` and ``weft`` tools to build a HTML
version of this file.  And from there we could use PrinceXML,
PhantomJS or wkhtmltopdf to convert the HTML file to a PDF.

For the curious, this file is used to test the function of the
quiet-text lexxer and parser and the ``warp`` utility.
